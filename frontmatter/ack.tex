\textit{I believe I know the only cure, which is to make
one's centre of life inside of one's self, not
selfishly or excludingly, but with a kind of
unassailable serenity-to decorate one's inner house
so richly that one is content there, glad to welcome
any one who wants to come and stay, but happy all
the same in the hours when one is inevitably alone.}
