\section{802.11ah Standrad}
 Explain what 802.11ah is.

 The 802.11ah protocol is one of the recent standards by IEEE organization. This standard introduces many new concepts for the first time, including new designs for both physical and MAC layer. In the physical layer take advantage of the new sub 1GHz ISM bandwidth and the MAC layer introduces the concept of Group Synchronized Distributed Coordination Function (GS-DCF) to be used instead of the traditional DCF.   
\section{The Hidden Terminal Problem}

Explain what hidden terminal problem is.

The hidden terminal is a traditional problem in wireless communication. Is usually happens when a node falls outside of sensing area of another node but they are both trying to communicate with a same node. Figure \ref{fig:hidden} illustrates a general case for the hidden terminal problem. For example, if the node A, first start the transmission of a packet to node B, and sometime in the middle of their communication, node C also decides to transmit a packet to B, according to the CSMA/CA procedure it will first listen to the channel, an since it can not sense the transmission coming from A. it will find the channel ideal and initiate its transmission to B which will result in collision and loss of both packets of A and C. Wireless LAN in the infrastructure mode considering the up-link transmission, since every other node wants for transmit to the access point, are vulnerable to this problem. 


\begin{figure} [!tbp]

  \caption{A simple hidden terminal problem}
  \label{fig:hidden}
\end{figure}

The legacy solution for this problem is the use of Request To Send(RTS) and Clear To Send(CTS) messages. Using these messages, every node has to send an RTS to its receiver and wait to get a CTS before starting a transmission. In this way, although node C might not sense the RTS from node A, it will receive the CTS that B sends to A and know that the channel for B is going to be busy. The only chance of collision because of the hidden terminal then is during the transmission of the RTS message. Since the RTS is a small control message, collision probability will be reduced significantly. 

Given the extended range of communication in the 802.11ah standard, this problem becomes even more serious.  

\section{Related Works}

\cite{tsertou2008revisiting} has considered the hidden terminal with a new approach in a Constant Contention Window (CCW) scenario and studied the problem of two competing senders that cannot sense each other but are trying to transmit to a station that both can sense, a frequent situation in infrastructure mode networks.

One solution for the hidden terminal problem is using RTS/CTS mechanism. This mechanism solves the problem for the case that the transmission time of a data packet is much larger than that of RTS/CTS. However, it introduces additional overhead, and the collisions cannot be avoided due to the RTS packets from hidden terminals. In \cite{yoonregrouping}, the hidden terminal problem in GS-DCF based networks was discussed. The proposed hidden matrix based regrouping (HMR) algorithm can reduce the number of hidden terminals but it is a centralized approach and requires the access point to discover hidden terminal relationship between two nodes first and then solve it by regrouping one of them to another group.

The research in \cite{tseng2014effective} has also studied the hidden terminal problem but in IEEE 802.15.4-based networks. A grouping mechanism similar to IEEE 802.11ah is proposed but the strategy to deal with the hidden terminal problem is still based on discovering hidden terminal relationships and rescheduling nodes.

\cite{abichar2013group} proposed a Group-based MAC where a new station join a group if the estimated distance to the group leader is below half of the transmission distance to avoid hidden-terminal, and otherwise a new group will be formed. The AP cannot effectively control the number of groups.

%The optimum way to have location based groups and solve most of potential hidden terminal problems would be the case that access point knows location information of each node and uses a clustering algorithm such as K-Means to categorize nodes in different groups and then assign each node to its designated group in way similar to centralized grouping schemes described in \cite{zheng2014performance}. 
When the AP can obtain the global information about the location of all nodes, existing clustering algorithms such as k-means can be applied and the group designation is completely controlled by the AP in a way similar to centralized grouping schemes described in \cite{zheng2014performance}.

However, when the number of terminals is large, collecting global information significantly increases the overhead of feedback. Assigning all of the nodes to their groups results in a high control overhead especially when the network is dynamic.


\section{System Model} \label{systemmodel}

In this work, we consider an infrastructure based IEEE 802.11ah network, where each wireless terminal transmits its packets directly to the access point. %For simplicity, we only consider upload traffic from nodes to the access point, same as the in \cite{wu2006wsn02}. 
The network coverage area is a circle with radius $R$ where the access point is at the center. Nodes are uniformly distributed in the circle and their locations follow a Poisson Point Process (PPP) with density $\lambda$. The latter two assumptions are used for analysis and they are not necessary for the algorithm to perform. Nodes are assumed to be static at their position which is a reasonable assumption for most IoT and sensor networks and an active node always has a packet to transmit. %Active nodes are assumed to have saturated traffic. % which means every node has always a packet to transmit.

The channel model used in the analysis is a pathloss model with parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in a way that the received power at a distance $d$ from the transmitter node is
\begin{equation}
P_r(d)=\frac{\beta}{d^\alpha} P_t,
\end{equation}
where $P_t$ is transmit power. In the simulation, we also consider the Rayleigh fast-fading and log-normal shadowing model where the received power is an exponential random variable and its mean $\bar{\gamma}$ is a log-normal random variable as 
\begin{equation}
\bar{\gamma}_{dB}= \mathcal{N}(10\log_{10}(P_r(d)),\sigma).
\end{equation}

%From a statistical geometric point of view, distance distribution of nodes in the same group is identical in all the schemes that are not location-based and nodes are uniformly distributed in a circle of size $A$. Therefore in this paper
We refer to both centralized and distributed schemes used in \cite{zheng2014performance} as random grouping schemes. We also do not distinguish between RAW slot crossing and not crossing cases known as CR-GS-DCF and NCR-GS-DCF respectively which has negligible impact on the grouping decision \cite{Draft80211ah}.

\subsection{RSS-Based Grouping}
\label{rssbasedmain}
In order to avoid disadvantages of a centralized solution mentioned before, one can utilize the idea of measuring the sensed power from other nodes to let users choose their own groups based on which group their neighbors are in. Here we propose a grouping scheme based on sensed power from other nodes. % and make a comparison between them.
The grouping mechanism should be triggered by the access point (AP) using its Beacon Frame (BF) at each Grouping Update Period (GUP) and nodes should listen to the channel for the sensed power of pilot messages from group heads. Such a BF at the beginning of a GUP is called a $\text{Beacon}^\ast$ and its difference with conventional beacon frames is that there is a grouping procedure at its beginning. 



%\subsection{Semi-Centralized Average Power Based (S-CAP)}

%In the Previous schemes there is a chance that a RAW remains empty until next GUP if they no successful transmission in that RAW. In order to prevent that from happening hereWe propose a semi-centralized strategy that instead of using the average received power from conventional transmission, a node will listen to some pilot messages from randomly chosen nodes in a reserved time slot called Grouping Slot Time(GST) by an order specified by AP.
We propose an RSS-based strategy that a node will listen to some pilot messages from randomly chosen nodes in a reserved time slot called Grouping Slot Time (GST) by an order specified by the AP.

\begin{algorithmic}
\FOR{Each GUP}
\STATE AP chooses $M$ random nodes (group heads)
\STATE AP informs group heads about their index in BF
\STATE AP includes $M$ in BF
\FOR {Each node}
\IF {It is a group head}
\STATE Transmits a pilot in its own GST
\ELSE
\STATE Measure power of each GST
\ENDIF
\ENDFOR
\STATE At the end of last GST
\FOR {Each node}
\IF {It is a group head}
\STATE Joins the group with its GST index
\ELSE
\STATE Joins the Group with the largest power GST index
\ENDIF
\ENDFOR
\ENDFOR
\end{algorithmic}

A time diagram of the algorithm is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:diagram} and an example of Voronoi cells is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:samplevonoroli}.


\begin{figure*} [!tbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figures/diagram}
  \caption{Time diagram of RSS-based grouping algorithm, $\text{Beacon}^{\ast}$ is a BF initiating the grouping scheme. As it is shown in the figure, a GUP can be as large as several beacon intervals. Essentially it can last as long as the AP is satisfied with the throughput performance.}
  \label{fig:diagram}
\end{figure*}

%Another schemes could be the case that access point assigns $M$ random nodes to $M$ different groups and then asks them to transmit their packet in the next beacon period (or a pilot packet if they do not have any) and other nodes will choose the RAW with largest avg received power. The first $M$ group assignments will be done like the centralized method previously used in 802.11ah. 

%Just like previous scheme 
Groups are formed in Voronoi cells around group heads. Nodes will then remain in their selected RAW until another trigger from the AP.
%This scheme does not have disadvantages of above mentioned scheme but it is not as distributed as other schemes.
Comparing to centralized schemes studied in \cite{zheng2014performance} which want the AP to assign each node to a group, this scheme has a much lower control overhead and it does not require any location information to be collected and exchanged in the network.% but it has still more overhead than the aforementioned scheme (DAP).

In the rare case that a node is very far from all the group heads, which means that it can not have any measurement for any GST, it will randomly choose one of the groups.
%In the RSS-based grouping algorithm, it is mentioned that the pilot transmissions in GST should have a higher power than usual transmissions to prevent the case that a node cannot sense a signal in any GST.
 %which is again a case that can happen in DAP algorithm. Because of such unsolved issues about the first strategy we only study performance of RSS-based grouping scheme in this paper and compare it to other random schemes and optimum solution.

  \label{fig:samplevonoroli}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Implementation Issues}
The proposed scheme can be readily implemented in current IEEE 802.11 systems without any major modifications. The power measurement already exists in the MAC layer of all systems and they can provide RSSI at any time, so nodes can then find the sensed power of each GST transmission by measuring the average RSSI during the reception time of the pilot. 

GST can be as small as an ACK time and there should be some guard distance time between pilot transmissions from group heads. For the best performance, the optimum value of GUP and GST should be determined which is beyond the scope of this paper and they do not affect our following analysis. The grouping can also be triggered by the AP if the randomly selected headers result in unsatisfactory network performance.

Including $M$ in BF is something that is already being done in the IEEE standard draft \cite{Draft80211ah}. Informing group heads about their index can also be done using a mapping strategy similar to the one used for delivery traffic indication known as DTIM.

Our algorithm is also robust against interference from other APs. Since the GSTs are short and they could be transmitted consecutively with a gap of SIFS, any other CSMA/CA based station, e.g. other APs, cannot transmit anything during the grouping procedure.

\subsection{Analytical Model}

In order to compare the performance of grouping schemes on hidden-terminal probability, here we define two metrics and use them along with the probability of having a hidden terminal in a group to show the benefits and costs of each grouping scheme. The first metric is the average distance between nodes in a group, $D_m$, which is defined as
\begin{equation}
D_m=\frac{\sum_{i} \sum_{j \neq i} d_{ij}}{{n_m \choose 2}},  \quad \quad \forall i \text{ and } j \in \text{group $m$},
\end{equation}
where $n_m$ is the number of nodes in group $m$ and $d_{ij}$ is the distance between nodes $i$ and $j$.

The second metric is the standard deviation of the number of nodes in different groups which specifies how evenly nodes are distributed between different groups.
\begin{equation}
\sigma=\sqrt{\frac{1}{M}\sum_{m=0}^{M-1}\left( n_m - \frac{N}{M} \right)^2},
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the total number of nodes and $M$ is the number of available groups.

The next step is finding the probability of encountering the hidden terminal problem for different schemes. The number of group head nodes in our proposed strategy is fixed so their locations follow Binomial Point Process (BPP) and there are $M$ of them in the entire coverage area. Thus, the probability that there are $k$ group heads in an area of size $B$ can be found as
\begin{equation}
Pr[ N(B)=k | N(A)=M]={M \choose k} \left( \frac{B}{A} \right)^k \left( 1- \frac{B}{A} \right)^{M-k},
\end{equation}
where $A=\pi R^2$ is total area of network. We use $D$ to denote the distance between one node and its nearest group head. Every node will find its nearest group head, therefore for the CDF of $D$ we have
\begin{equation}
F_D(x)=1-Pr[N(S(x))=0 | N(A)=M] \quad x \geq 0,
\end{equation}
where $S(x)$ is the overlapping area between a circle centered at the observed node with radius $x$ and the coverage area. In general $S(x) \leq \pi x^2$ and the inequality happens for nodes close to the coverage area's border. We define $\hat{F_D(x)}$ by
\begin{equation}
\hat{F_D(x)}=1-Pr[N(\pi x^2)=0 | N(A)=M] \quad 0 \leq x \leq R.
\end{equation}
It is always true that $\hat{F_D(x)} \geq F_D(x)$ for $0 \leq x \leq R$. However, when M is large enough, which is typically the case in practice \cite{zheng2014performance} the group size is so small comparing with the whole network area that the difference between $F_D(x)$ and $\hat{F_D(x)}$ becomes negligible. We use the latter as an upper-bound of the real case.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:cdf}
\begin{split}
F_D(x) \approx \hat{F_D(x)} &=1-Pr[N(\pi x^2)=0 | N(A)=M] \\
&=1- {M \choose 0} \left( \frac{\pi x^2}{A} \right)^0 \left( 1- \frac{\pi x^2}{A} \right)^{M} \\
&=1- \left( 1- \frac{\pi x^2}{A} \right)^{M} \quad 0 \leq x \leq R.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%The probability that $x \geq R$ is neglected in the above CDF because it is very low.
The validity of this approximation is then verified by simulation in Section \ref{evaluation}.

We can find PDF of $D$ by taking derivative of its CDF:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:pdf}
f_D(x)=\frac{2\pi M x}{A}(1-\frac{\pi x^2}{A})^{M-1} \quad 0 \leq x \leq R.
\end{equation}
Using this PDF we can find the probability of having a hidden terminal when our RSS-based grouping scheme is used.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{figures/webb2}
    \caption{Two nodes and group head in one Voronoi cell}
    \label{fig:geometrit}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:geometrit} shows a group head and a random node called node 1 in the same group in distance $X$ where $X$ follows the PDF in (\ref{eq:pdf}). \iffalse The other node is assumed to be anywhere Within Y distance of group head. \fi The circle C1 shows the sensing range of node 1 and C2 is a circle centered by the group head with the raduis Y which also follows the PDF in (\ref{eq:pdf}). The probability for node 2 which is Y away from the group head to be in the sensing range of node 1 is the ratio of the portion of C2 inside C1 to the perimeter of C2. Then, we can take the average over the PDF of $X$ and $Y$ to obtain the probability that two nodes are within each other's sensing range.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
Pr_{\text{sense}}=& \\
& \int_0^{\sqrt{\frac{A}{\pi}}}\int_0^{\sqrt{\frac{A}{\pi}}} \frac{g_1(x,y)}{2\pi y} f_X(x) f_Y(y) dxdy,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $Pr_{\text{sense}}$ is the probability that two nodes in the same group are in each other's sensing range, $R_s$ is the sensing range of a node, 
\begin{equation}
g_1(x,y)=
\begin{cases} 
      2\pi y & R_s\geq x+y \\
      2y\arccos(\frac{x^2+y^2-R_s^2}{2xy}) & R_s< x+y \\
      0 & R_s < |x-y| 
   \end{cases},
\end{equation}
and $f_X(x)$ and $f_Y(y)$ are the PDF of $X$ and $Y$ respectively. 

We can also derive the same probability for random grouping schemes. The probability density function for the distance between two random nodes in a circle with the radius $R$ is given in \cite{moltchanov2012distance}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
f(r)=\frac{2r}{R^2} & \left( \frac{2}{\pi}\arccos(\frac{r}{2R}) \right. \\
& \left.  - \frac{r}{\pi R} \sqrt{1- \frac{r^2}{4R^2}} \right ) ,\quad 0<r<2R.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
In this case, for random grouping, the probability of that two nodes in the same group are in each other's sensing region can be obtained as follows,
\begin{equation}
Pr_{\text{sense}}=\int_0^{2R}g_2(r)f(r)dr,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
g_2(r)=
\begin{cases} 
      1 & r \leq R_s \\
      0 & r > R_s
   \end{cases}.
\end{equation}
These probabilities can then be calculated by numerical methods.
